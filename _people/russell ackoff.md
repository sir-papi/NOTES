TOOL: [kome ai](https://kome.ai/tools/youtube-transcript-generator);<hr>  
  
after one of my books appeared and a student came in he said Professor I just read your new book he said it's very 
good contains a lot more than you 
know um that's true so I'm going in free 
willing I'm going to pick and choose from some of the things I said yesterday perhaps the most insulting part and to 
use today and my remarks have two foundations two ideas out of which they 
spring so let me deal with those first first is the concept of systems and what 
systems thinking implies a system is a whole that 
contains two or more parts Each of which can affect the properties or behavior of the whole for 
example you are a system a biological system called an organism and you have 
Parts like your heart's stomach lungs pancreas and so on each of which can affect your properties and your 
behavior the second requirement of the parts of a system is that none of them has an 
independent effect on the hole how any part affects the hole depends on what 
other parts are doing so the way your heart affects you depends on the behavior of the lungs the brain and so 
on the parts are all interconnected between any two parts of a system there's a direct or an indect 
direct path and finally if you group the parts of a system in the subgroups no matter 
how you subgroup them each subgroup will have an effect on the properties and the behavior of the whole and none will have 
an independent effect and therefore you can summarize those three characteristics of a system 
into a simple statement a system as a whole that cannot be divided into independent 
parts now this has a number of consequences which are not apparent but are incredibly 
important the first is the essential properties of any system derive out of 
how its parts interact not on how they act taken 
separately and therefore the defining properties of any system are properties 
of the whole which none of its parts have for example an automobile is a 
mechanical system and its essential property is its ability to carry you from one place to to another but no part 
of it can do that there's no part of an automobile it's motor its body its seats 
that can carry you from one place to another it's only the automobile taken as a whole your essential property is life 
there's no part of you which separately lives life is a property of the 
whole and therefore when the hole is disassembled it loses its essential 
properties and so do all of its parts if we were to bring an automobile 
into this room and disassemble it but retain every part in the 
room we would not have an automobile what you have is a collection of the parts because the automobile is the 
product of the interaction of its parts not the sum of the parts taken separately and this has an incredibly 
important implication to management which the Western world has not yet learned and as a respons for the well 
documented decline of the West in any 
system when one improves the performance of the parts taken separately the 
performance of the whole does not necessarily improve and frequently gets 
worse the basic principle of management used in the western world is divide and 
conquer if it's a corporation you're dividing the production marketing Finance personnel and so on if it's a un 
University to break up in the Department's curricula and programs and then try to manage each one 
as well as possible on the assumption that when this is done the hole will be run as well as possible and that's 
absolutely false because when a system is operating as well as possible none of its parts 
may be now this can be proven rigorously in the system Sciences but I'll spare you 
that proof for one thing I don't remember it but there's a simple example that'll 
show you that it's true and why according to the New York Times there are 457 different automobiles 
available in the United States so imagine with me that we buy one of each and bring them into a huge garage and 
then get 200 of the best automotive engineers in the world to come in and we give them the problem of finding which 
car has the best motor suppose they come out and tell us the Rolls-Royce has the best engine and 
we make note of it and then say please find out which one has the best transmission tell us the Mercedes has 
the best transmission well which one has the best fuel injector well perhaps it's the Volkswagen and one by one we take 
every part required for an automobile and find out which is the best one available when that list is complete we 
return it to the engineers and instruct them to remove those parts from those cars and put them together into the best 
possible automobile because now we will have an automobile consisting of all the best available 
parts do we get the best possible automobile of course not you don't even 
get an automobile why not the parts don't fit 
it's the way the parts fit together to determine the performance of a system not on how they perform taken separately 
but we conduct systems like the university and corporations and hospitals as though the Improvement of 
the parts they can separately will improve the whole now that's one Foundation concept 
I'm going to use in talking about education the other one deres from a 
failure of our educational system to distinguish between the various forms of 
content of the Mind the simplest form of content of the Mind consists of 
data now there's an old aphorism that you may not have heard since there not what widely circulated among 
Educators goes as follows an ounce of information is worth a pound of 
data an ounce of knowledge is worth a pound of information an ounce of understanding is 
worth a pound of knowledge and an ounce of wisdom is worth a pound of understanding so we 
have a hierarchy of the content of Mind data information knowledge understanding and wisdom of increasing importance as 
you approach wisdom but the allocation of time in the educational system is inversely related 
to the importance of these contents most of the time is devoted to transmission of information and some to 
knowledge nothing to understanding and of course none to wisdom at all some 
have claimed that this is due to the fact you can't transmit what you don't [Music] 
have data consists of symbols which represent the properties of objects and 
events so if I asked each of you what your address 
is or how old you are how many children you have all of this would constitute 
data data are like iron or I can't do anything with them until they've been processed converted into iron 
information is iron it's data which had been processed to be useful and useful information is what is 
contained in descriptions description is the mode of transmission of 
information It's contained in the answer to questions to begin with such words as who where when what and how many so if 
somebody were to enter the campus and say where is a convocation occurring today they tell them in the auditorium 
that's descriptive that's information if they say how do I get there they will receive 
instruction and the content of instruction is knowledge its product is skill knowledge is contained in how to 
questions understanding is contained in explanations answers the questions to 
begin with the word why why in a world you want to go to the convocation an answer to that explains 
the desire to get here now wisdom is a qualitative change from the previous 
four data information knowledge and understanding are all concerned with 
increasing the efficiency with which we pursue our ends but they don't tell us anything about 
the ends that are being pursued they're in a sense value free wisdom makes a transition between 
efficiency and Effectiveness because it evaluates the the pursuit the end which 
we're pursuing efficiently it's contained the distinction is contained in a wonderful 
statement by Peter Ducker who once said there's a big difference between doing things right and doing the right 
thing you see we are very largely devoted to doing the wrong thing 
right that's very unfortunate because the wrer you do the wrong thing the wronger you 
become when we do the right thing wrong we make a mistake which when detected 
allows us to improve so the distinction is absolutely 
critical and we are a society which are simply drowning in the pursuit of the 
efficiency concerned with the pursuit of the wrong ends one simple and obvious example is 
our current concern with the health care System it isn't a Health Care System a 
moment's reflection will make it apparent that it isn't a Health Care System what do the servers of the Health 
Care System get paid for they get paid for taking care of you when you're sick or disabled it's a 
sickness and disability care system not a Health Care system now if the income 
of the servers deres out of taking care of you when you're sick and disabled you can be damn sure they're going to keep 
you sick and disabled they're not going to keep you healthy if they did they'd be out of 
business now what they say and what they declare is irrelevant it's what they will do even if unconsciously because 
the system is so constructed to focus on the maintenance of sickness and 
disability the same thing is true of most organizations corporations are not about 
maximization of profit all one has to do is look at the Executive offices and the 
way they move around and where they stay when they move around and see that it's not about maximizing profit it's about 
maximizing the comfort of the senior Executives and the university is not 
about the education of students that's a myth which we perpetrate in order to get public 
support the principal purpose of a university is apparent when you try to explain Its Behavior is to provide his 
faculty with the quality of work life they want teaching is the price they have to 
pay and like any price we try to minimize [Music] 
it just look at the universities of the United States and the colleges and rank them from the best to the worst you can 
start wherever you want to Harvard Stanford and someone work your way down at the Pica State teachers college and 
then plot the number of hours of teaching per Academic Year the average 
hours of the faculty what do you find an incredibly strong correlation at Harvard they teach at 
most 5 hours a year but in some universities is 15 
hours a semester or a quarter the implication is clear but we don't 
pay any attention to it the implication is the better the school is the less 
teaching there is you see the ideal school is one in which there's no 
teaching but a lot of learning and that's the First 
Fundamental myth about the educational system the myth is that a good way to 
learn something is to have it taught to you and that's absolutely false 
being taught is a major obstruction to learning now again any reflection will 
make this clear how did you learn your first language nobody taught it to you you 
learned it you learned to walk without having it taught to you how to ride a bicycle how to talk all the essential 
things of life you learn without having them talk taught to you how many of you ever learned a second language in school 
as well as you know your first language of course not if you want to learn a second language you go live in the 
country that speaks it you don't have it taught to you burlett never succeeded as well as living in a foreign country 
did teaching is an obstruction to learning but there's a very important 
characteristic of teaching how many of you have ever taught a class in a subject you never 
had as a student I suspect most of you have who learned most in the 
classroom although being taught is an obstruction to learning teaching is a 
marvelous way to learn what we are are professional Learners not 
teachers a student once asked me what's the last time you taught a course in a subject that existed when you were a 
student I had to think about about it it was 1951 1951 it's more than 40 years ago 
everything I've taught since then didn't exist when I was a student student looked at me and said my God you've had 
to learn a lot he said I wish you could teach as well as you can 
learn that's what we ought to be about the facilitation of learning not 
teaching the university and the college is upside down the students ought to be teaching because that's a good way to 
learn and we ought to be continuously learning so that we can enable them to learn more 
effectively the principal purpose of an institution of Higher Learning ought to have two prongs to it 
first to enable students to learn how to 
learn and secondly to motivate them to want to do so you see 50% of what you learn in a 
university is irrelevant to what you're going to do later how many of you remember how to 
take a square root the other 50% will be obsolete within a couple 
years your success in life after leaving a university depends on your ability to 
learn in your job or in your activity what you need to know to do the job 
well your future depends on your capacity to learn and your motivation to do so motivation is absolutely critical 
we ignore it we almost deliberately design classes to demotivate students so 
that they don't want to learn we make a chore out of it I told a story yesterday 
was of an experience I had that was really Illuminating to 
me my group at the university did a lot of collaborative work with a neighboring 
so-called black ghetto an area called mancho consisting of 80 city blocks with 
22,000 people in it all black it was referred to in the city in 
the' 60s when we started working with him is the bottom it has since received 17 national 
awards for self-development effort it's been the subject of seven major national television programs and its leadership 
has received all kinds of recognition one day its leaders came 
into my office and said we got a problem and maybe you can help us with it we have too much ill literacy coming 
out of our schools about 80% of the students even coming out of high school they said are 
functionally illiterate what can we do about it we said we said why don't you get a hold of 
the Board of Education they have a special group working on the literacy problem they said we've already done that they came in and they didn't do us 
any good we said well we don't know anything about something this some this product 
problem and they said well that's an advantage because the people who do can help 
us so why don't you try well we did know one thing about the 
community which turned out to be essential those kids were not stupid they were smart as a devil they weren't 
educated but boy were they smart and therefore if they weren't learning how to read it's because they didn't want 
to so we conducted research to find out why did they not want to learn how to 
read well the results were incredible 65% of the households in that 
area did not contain a book the kids coming to school had never seen an adult 
read their model adults were not reading people but talking people their culture 
was oral not literary and then they come to school where a blond white woman tells them 
that reading is the most important thing in the world and they answer in two impolite 
words secondly we learned learned that when a young man reaches the age of 12 joining a gang was compulsory it was the 
only way he could survive physically by moving around the neighborhood with friends that would help protect 
him if on the other hand he was ever seen carrying a book he would be physically attacked even by members of 
his own gang because a book was referred to as Whitey thing it was capitulation to a 
dominating culture and so they didn't carry books around and they didn't read books at 
home and they didn't see people reading books at home and now we're trying to make them learn how to read rap was not an invention of the 
whites or the blacks it's an oral culture well what can we do about it 
when we had an idea and we fortunately had somebody who was willing to finance an effort to try it 
out Julius Rosenwald who was the son of the founder of Sears lives in 
Philadelphia and is an old friend so we approached him and he agreed to finance a very peculiar effort we bought a 
complete set of Charlie Chaplain silent films put them in the auditorium of the 
schools in this neighborhood and played them during the entire school day and 
any child was allowed to come and sit in the auditorium and watch Charlie Chaplain without an excuse from their 
teacher by the end of that semester every kid in the school could read 
why they wanted to read the subtitles they couldn't understand what 
was going on and they wanted to and so they learned and it wasn't taught to them they got 
motivated education has to focus on motivation what excites people well the 
great Spanish philosopher OTA Orga oset has a marvelous book called the 
mission of the university in which he traces the evolution of 
revolutions and he concludes that every major revolution in the world's history 
was created by what he calls a mobilizing idea ideas that excite people into 
action holy Grails of thought how much effort do we put into 
the production and dissemination of mobilizing ideas ideas that diverge from the 
normal you see universities and colleges and the public schools are largely 
devoted to maintaining the status quo not to producing 
change there is a very remarkable man floating around this country in England by the name of Edward 
debono Edward debono is responsible for the research that was initiated about two decades ago into the subject of 
creativity he got into it in a very interesting way he had married and they 
had their first child and debono was fascinated by the development of his child and so it began to log everything 
you know if the child said ooh he recorded January the 4th the child said ooh when January the 5th he said ah and 
he put all this down and pretty soon he observed that the child demonstrated remarkable 
creativity he began to look at other children and discovered they were equally creative the creativity was not 
a sparse competence it was widely spread among children and then he looked at 
adults and said oh my God what happened to them somewhere along the line people who 
are born with a creative capability lose it he said 
why well he never answered the question but two others did what he did 
is go on to prate create procedures for are revitalizing the 
remnants of creativity in adults they're called creativity enhancing procedures and he wrote a famous book called 
straight and lateral thinking in which he demonstrates some of those principles but Jules Henry an American 
Anthropologist wrote an incredible book called culture against man and Ronald 
Lang a prominent British psychiatrist who recently died wrote a book called the politics of experience and they 
dealt with the why question and they both came out with the same 
answer we do it in school we kill creativity when you are given an 
examination in school and you read the question what's the first thing that goes through the students mind they 
learn very quickly that the thing to do when you're given a question is to ask 
yourself a question what's the question you ask yourself what answer do they expect 
examinations are about trying to anticipate the answers expected by the 
teacher expected answers cannot be creative because they're already 
known if we use examinations at all they ought to be about encouraging students to give us the unexpected 
answer because that's what creativity is about it's about surprise deviation from 
expectations and furthermore or as Jules Henry pointed out we don't even allow the students to ask the critical 
questions on their mind what's so good about monogamy what's so bad about premarital 
sex what's so hot about our economic 
system what's so good about democracy questions of this sort are not 
discussed with the kids they're put aside they learn very quickly not to ask important questions and not to provide 
important answers and we wonder where creativity goes It goes down the drain with 
Conformity to expectations of the faculty which simply 
reflect the expectations of society Jules Henry asked what would 
happen if we encourage kids to ask the so-called improper question and to 
provide improper answers he said we would be confronted with more creativity and Society has 
learned how to handle and that's our fear too much creativity as a result we have too 
little of it I once got very tired of reading the handwriting of graduate students like 
many of you have I'm sure even with undergraduates so I came into a class 
the beginning of a session one year and said you're going to do a term paper and out of that paper I have to to 
extract a Content I can't do it with your handwriting you're going to have to type your paper double space typing on 8 1/2 
by 11 white sheets with at least 1 in margins and I 
want the pages numbered in the upper right hand corner is that absolutely clear and they all nodded and said 
yes the end of that semester I received every paper typewritten as I had 
directed and they were legible but there was one that I got that was typed this 
way at the end of the paper there was a little remark it said 
ahuh I got you didn't I my initial reaction was that damn kid 
knew what I wanted and deliberately wouldn't give it to me I was going to reject this paper and 
then I stopped and reflected and said my God look what he did he spent time 
trying to figure out how to fool me how to surprise me he was 
creative so I give him an A+ and I added a note don't ever try it 
again because it won't be creative the next 
time I have sat for years through faculty meetings there are two things 
I've learned about it one uh as a member of The Faculty of the 
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania I was selected one year to be the Wharton representative on the 
faculty of the College of Engineering the town school and so for two years I had to sit in town school meetings of 
the faculty they were even more boring than the Wharton School 
meetings and so having nothing else to do I try to record the subject matters 
discussed and the princi Concepts used in the discussion and in two years the word 
student was mentioned only once only once faculty meanss are about 
the faculty they're properly called they weren't about students they weren't about education learning they're about 
benefits and academic freedom and all this sort of stuff that affect the faculty 
schedules but not about students and I learned that the faculty 
operates on the assumption that it knows what the students need to know and that's absolutely false you 
haven't the foggiest idea what students need to know I sat while Engineers 
argued for hours about what courses ought to be required for a degree in engineering and they ignored the fact 
long known that 65% of The Graduate Engineers do not practice engineering 
within 5 years after graduation that 35% of the phds never 
practice in the field in which they reive their PHD a few years 
ago the American statistical Association one of the largest professional Societies in the United States had a 
100th anniversary and they did a very clever thing they solicited the membership with 
a ballot asking us to nominate the four people we would like 
most to address this at the 100th anniversary celebration to be held in New York 
now they got a whole bunch of names they took the names most frequently mentioned made a second 
ballot and sent it out to get selection from that and they proceeded this is 
called a deli technique until they got it down to four speakers and those four were invited to address the hund 
celebration that was quite a to-do it turned out that not one of the 
four who were selected by 15,000 members as the most important contrib iors to 
the development of Statistics in the United States not one of them had ever had a course in 
statistics proving the obvious thing that changes in the field are never produced by 
experts but from Outsiders looking at the 
field how do we train people to look at things creatively and encourage them to 
do so rather than to act as is a combination of a computer a recording 
device and a video camera and simply spill back to them what we've given to 
them that's not human this is exemplified in the ultimate insult to human intelligence 
called computer assisted instruction what an insult I have a computer 
[Applause] to the idea of having a computer teach a person it's reversed 
right at the Hawkin School in Cleveland we did an experiment where we took second grade students and this was a day 
when computers were complicated univac 2 you had to program in machine 
language and we gave the second grade the responsibility for teaching the 
computer arithmetic and in one semester they learned two years four semesters of 
elementary school arithmetic how did they learn it on their own and with help they use the 
teacher as a resource not as a teacher but as somebody would help them 
learn Ellis Johnson a professor at Johns Hopkins University who moved to case 
Institute in the 1960s got an experimental Grant from the National 
Science Foundation and conducted a most unusual experiment he took 60 of the accepted in 
coming students to case Institute of Technology undergraduates and offered them a summer 
job prior to their entry to school they all accepted because he offered a generous 
salary they were put together in teams of five and they were given the real problem to work on and to work for 
somebody in the public institution or private who had the problem to solve so 
this was a realistic exercise for example one group was sent to Mayfield Heights Ohio 
to improve the water supply system because the pressure was running low from overuse of the existing system 
another one was sent to another part of the Cleveland area to develop an emergency service for the new Expressway 
that was built through the area and so on I was in Ellis's office one day when 
one of these groups came in working on the hydraulic problem it said uh Dr 
Johnson we've developed an equation to express the flow of water through this system we like to show it to you and see 
if it's right and they wrote it up on the board and he looked at it he said no he said that's that's right he said now 
here's our problem what we have to do is manipulate these two variables so as to maximize the output we don't know how to 
do that is it possible to do it he said yeah I said that's a problem in differential 
calculus they said well can you teach it to us he said no he said well how are we going to do it he said you got to learn 
it well how we going to learn it he said well I'll tell you where the book books are you can go get the books and read it 
now if you have any problems you can come and ask me about them but I'm not going to teach it to you well they did 
that at the end of that summer 95% of the students involved in that 
exercise passed the first two years of mathematics at case Institute of Technology by 
examination that's what I mean by teaching is an obstruction to learning when motivated to learn mathematics they 
learn it and an incredible speed many years ago we did research on 
alcoholism and came out with a theory which we're able to test and proved 
valid one of our students a young man by the name of Robert cour got very excited about it he came to see me one day he 
said that stuff on alcoholism is really exciting he said I wonder if it would work on drug addiction I said well it 
might in part but I think they're a different phenomena so there'd be some required adjustment he said I'd like to look into 
it can you support me for a couple months while I try to find out something about drug addicts we said how much time 
you want he said 3 months and we dug up the money and gave it to him he disappeared 3 months later he appeared 
in my office and said I've written a proposal for research on drug addiction I'd like you to tell me what you think 
about it he showed it to me and it was incredible with minor modification I submitted it to National Institute of 
Health and got 360,000 for research on drug addiction that's not the point of the 
story the point of the story is that Bob Court the young man who did allas was invited by the medical school of the 
hospital University of Pennsylvania to come over and give a course on drug addiction to the 
doctors he never had a course in medicine never known anything about drug addiction but he came to campus's 
Leading expert on a subject how he learned it wasn't taught to him 
I had a group of foreign students from less developed countries come in to see me one day headed up by a young Peruvian 
named Francisco sagasti and seconded by a young lady called Virginia Meo she was Brazilian he 
was Peruvian they said a number of the faculty here have done work on planning for development of less developed 
countries why don't we have a course on planning for development for 
Less developed countries I said that was a great idea he pointed out that we had students in our student 
body from 13 less developed countries they make an anxious group of 
students I said no that wasn't acceptable they could teach such a 
course he said well what do you mean if we were to teach the course who would be the students I said the five members of 
The Faculty that you've identified he said you mean you would actually come as students to the class I 
said yes he said well will you attend regularly we said uh yes if you don't Bor 
us we will behave just like you do will you read the 
assignments well if they're worth reading and so on he said that's awfully 
difficult he said we can't give such a course until we know what you already know I said right he said how are we 
going to learn what you already know I said that's your job that's what we have 
to do when we teach we got to find out what you already know so you do the same for us he said 
well can we do it next semester rather than this one he said yeah and they did 
those 13 students put on the best course I have ever taken Francisco sagasi became the chief 
strategic planner for the World Bank and is now the chief planner for the government of Peru Virginia Meo is the 
chief planner for the government of Brazil and every one of those 13 people 
hold a major planning function in a less developed country they were so 
excited by their experience of learning through teaching we've got the university and 
the college upside down we think we know what they have to learn that's unimportant what's important is that 
they learn how to learn now a few other 
characteristics of our educational system have to be changed we may make an absolutely 
incredible assumption that the world is organized the way a university 
is now what does that mean well we say experience involves physical problems 
chemical problems psychological problems social problems economic problems philosophical problems religious 
problems and so on there are different kinds of problems and so we organize around these 
different kinds of problems we take reality apart into disciplines and we think a discipline 
represents reality there is no such thing as a 
physical problem a chemical problem a social problem an economic problem those are absolute 
Illusions those adjectives don't tell you a damn thing about a problem they tell you something but not about the 
problem but we treat them as though they tell you something about the problem we don't even tell students what 
the are of disciplines is one of the most exciting things I 
ever read is the first sentence of a book called on human communication by Colin Cherry a British cybernetician and 
information theorist who spent 1976 on a sabatical year at MIT and wrote this 
book and the first sentence of the book reads as follows the German philosopher 
libnet was probably the last living man who knew 
everything what an exciting idea so I went back to look into it he 
was literally true liet spoke 12 languages he made major contributions to 
mathematics and science as we knew it that day the entire domain of science 
was capable of being contained in a single human brain but after livets that became 
increasingly impossible as the domain of human knowledge enlarged 
the first division that occurred occurred at the time of Newton Newton was not a professor of 
physics physics didn't existed didn't exist when Newton was there Newton was a professor of natural 
philosophy because the first division that occurred in the domain of human knowledge was between philosophy and 
natural philosophy now they didn't have the guts to call the other part unnatural philosophy which it was 
and then natural philosophy divided into physics and chemistry and as recently as 1900 there 
were only six Sciences physics chemistry biology psychology and 
sociology six Sciences currently on the register of the national research Council are 450 
disciplines see disciplines are in a fact of nature they represent a filing 
system for knowledge they're exactly a filing system you probably have a file 
in your office with multiple drawers and one drawer reads a to c and the next drawer D to F and so 
on there are ways of retaining information so you can get access to it 
easily the fact that Armco steel and Alcoholics Anonymous are in the same file don't mean a damn thing it's just a 
convenient way of getting them if you rearrange your file by date of receipt rather than alphabetically you wouldn't 
change the content one bit you just change your way of access to it now all 
the disciplines are are labels on files there are nothing about the content of 
the files that's an absolute illusion let me give you an 
example this ghetto that I referred to earlier so-called 
ghetto uh in its development process started to meet with the faculty a 
select group of the faculty University regularly every Monday morning and during one of these Monday morning 
meetings which occurring in my office a young man from the community came in with a piece of news that 
stopped the meeting absolutely dead we had to terminate because of the sadness of the 
information there was an 83 year-old woman who lived in the neighborhood who 
had organized what we called a geriatric set these were elderly people who were 
retired most of them on welfare or Social Security who had organized things like infant care centers they took care 
of children from several weeks old up till the time when they're old enough to go to a daycare center so that their 
unwed teenage mothers could either return to school or go to work they cleared vacant lots to make them usable 
as Recreation and rest cent They planted trees in the neighborhood and flowers and things of this sort there were real 
to the neighborhood we were able to do something for that woman indirectly that 
neighborhood I had absolutely no medical facilities whatsoever and we got the University of 
Pennsylvania Hospital to open the free clinic in the neighborhood which was the first time they had medical services 
available to them this enabled this old woman to go there once a month for a checkup which she needed because she had 
a bad heart she had gone to that clinic that morning and had gone through the usual 
check had passed it and they had released her to go home home were two 
rooms at the top of an old four-story house that had been converted into a 
tenement and on the third flight of stairs on her way to her home she had had a heart attack and 
died that's the news that was brought to us and so we sat around the room 
silently and the first one to speak was a professor of community medicine who was in the room room Sam 
Martin he said damn it I told you we don't have enough doctors in the clinic you see if we have more doctors 
in a clinic we'd be able to make house calls for patients that shouldn't be coming to us we should be going to them 
we've got to arrange to get more doctors it was silence Jerry Adams The Economist spoke 
up next he said Sam there are plenty of doctors in Philadelphia that's not the problem he said the problem is they're 
private practitioner and she couldn't afford to call one if her welfare payments or health 
benefits were higher this never would have happened she'd been able to call a doctor to her home to give her the 
exam silence professor of architecture said why don't we make them put elevators in 
all those buildings and then the only woman present a professor of Social Work shook 
her head and said my God what a Pity none of you know anything about that woman don't you know she was married and 
had a son she was deserted by her husband shortly after the son was born and by working in in house cleaning she 
raised that son managed to get him through school at 
the top of his class he got a scholarship and came to pen and got a degree in Arts and Sciences graduated at 
top of his class and got a scholarship to the law school he went to the law school graduated at the top of his class 
and is now after several years of employment one of the Philadelphia law 
firms a major principal in that firm he is married and has two children 
he lives in the suburbs on so-called Main Line in a beautiful home with two 
children and a wife it happens to be a bungalow and if she weren't alienated 
from her son she'd be living with him where she'd have all the money she needs and no steps to 
climb now here's the question what kind of a problem was that is that a medical 
problem in economic problem an architectural problem or a social work problem it's none of them it's a 
problem those adjectives describe the point of view of the person looking at 
the problem they don't tell you anything about the problem they tell you about the person looking at it but that's not 
the way we teach disciplines we give students the wrong impression that they tell you something 
about the problem now I've had the remarkable opportunity to work in over 
400 different corporations in my lifetime and more than 75 government agencies in over 17 different 
countries and I've never run across a problem that couldn't better be solved somewhere other than where it was 
recognized but what happens in reality in a corporation the marketing manager 
comes in one morning and finds out the sales dropped in New England uhoh he says we got a marketing 
problem and he now takes possession of that problem because it's a marketing problem and tries to solve it by the 
manipulation of marketing variables but that problem may be much 
better solved someplace else but that never occurs to him because he was taught there is such a thing as a 
marketing problem this is what interdisciplinarity is all about I told 
a story yesterday which illustrates this perhaps better than anything I can say 
it's a story of an office building in New York City which at the end of World War II received increasing 
complaints from its tenants about the poor elevator service these complaints kept mounting 
and management didn't know what it could do about it but eventually some of the major clients in the building multiflor 
occupants like accounting firms and law firms threatened to break their lease and move out because their uh their 
employ employees were complaining so much about long delays for elevators so management finally took the 
problem seriously did a little inquiry and found out there's a group of elevator Engineers or experts in the 
area and they called him and asked them to come in explained the difficulty and the engineers said we have to do a 
survey to find out how serious the problem is and so they were authorized to do so for a fee of 
course and they came back several weeks later and said you got a problem 
the average waiting time for an elevator in this building is about 2 minutes they said the American Standard 
is 20 seconds which means that you're keeping waiting people waiting six times 
as long as the desirable average you've got a problem the 
management said what can we do about it the engineer said there are only three things you can do about it one is you 
could add elevators that means you'd have to take part of the building that's occupied by other things now and put 
elevators second thing you can do is use automated elevators which move more quickly than 
the old elevators which you got the third thing you can do is introduce computer controls to your 
elevator system this would enable an elevator when it reaches the 20th floor 
and there's nobody waiting above to go down to the first floor instead of going up to the top before it comes down this 
saves time and increases the availability of elevators and management said which one 
of these is the best he said we don't know you have to do research to find out so they got a great big juicy 
contract they went off and did the research came back after several months and a couple million dollars 
later and said you got a problem what do you mean said well in 
order to add a sufficient number of elevators to solve the problem you've got to reduce the runable space in this 
building by an amount that you can't possibly justify by the change in 
income it would be a bad investment but what about automating the elevators well that will only reduce the 
time to about 1 minute which is still three times too much what about computer 
controls same thing they said what are we going to do said management engineer 
said you can't do anything it's an old building and it's a it's the cost of age 
and they left complaints kept going on and finally management became absolutely 
desperate and decided to do something would never do Under normal circumstances these were absolutely unique conditions so they called a 
meeting of their subordinates the head of each department 
in the building was called and everyone came a large building like this employs between two 
and 400 people except a had of personnel Department he was off on a trip and he 
sent his young assistant who was a recent graduate in Personnel Psychology from Penn 
State and when they entered the room management described the problem to them and the result of the engineering study 
he said what I want to do here today is brainstorming he said now this is what brainstorming is I'm going to ask you if 
you have any ideas of how we can solve the problem and somebody will make a suggestion now nobody can say what's 
wrong with the suggestion why it won't work if you don't think it'll work you have to say what you would do to it to 
make it workable so every contribution has to be constructive working our way 
toward a solution is that understood and everybody nodded he said okay let's have 
a suggestion somebody raised his hand and made it and everybody immediately told them why it wouldn't 
work three or four of these occurred in a row and pretty soon people stopped making 
suggestions there was a long silence in the room and the manager got desperate up at the front of the room and finally 
he looked at the young man he said you haven't said a word he said don't you have any ideas he said sure he said I do 
have an idea but I'm ashamed to present it he said people will make fun of me he 
said we we don't have the luxury of making fun of you what's your idea and the young boy told him two weeks later 
at a cost of $500 the problem was dissolved now what had he done see 
everybody had said the problem consists of slow or not enough 
elevators we've got to add elevators or increase their speed feet but that's not 
the way the young man looked at it he said people standing there for 2 minutes 
are bored they've got nothing to do and they're complaining about the boredom therefore how do I entertain 
them so they won't mind the wait it's a very different 
problem the solution was simple he put mirrors up in the lobby so they can spend their time looking at each 
other that has become standard practice you will find now in most modern buildings elevator lobbies will have 
mirrors all around cuz now the men can look at the women without appearing to do so and vice 
versa that's what interdisciplinarity is all about it means exploring the 
different points of view around the problem to find which one or combination of points of view will'll give you the 
best solution nobody owns a problem every problem is 
universal okay so a university is not 
organized the way reality is or vice 
versa a great deal of our effort as Educators is to teach people how to solve problems problem 
solving now the fact is we very s give them a problem what we usually do is give them exercises or ask them 
questions well what's the difference you say that's the problem we treat problems exercises and 
questions as though they're all the same thing and they're very very different for 
example I have a friend who's very well known in mathematical circles as the inventor of mathematical puzzles of deep 
significance because their solution always requires some major development of mathematics his name is Merl flood he 
was a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan and recently retired from the University of 
California he invented a very well-known problem in mathematics called the traveling salesman problem of all things 
and he used to love to give me puzzles whenever we met so I met him one day he said I got a new one for you he said we 
got a bowl a glass balll is full of balls all the same size some of the 
balls are white and some are black you reach into the ball and come out with a handful of N 
Balls you put them down and look at them and M out of the N Balls are black and 
therefore n minus M balls are white he said now you reach into the 
ball and pull out one ball at random what's the probability it will be black I said that's easy said what do 
you mean it's easy it's an unsolved problem in statistics I said it may be unsolved in statistics but it's an easy 
problem he said what do you mean how can it be easy I said you just tell me now you know that the ball contains only 
black and white balls and I'll tell you the answer oh no he said I can't do that it'll spoil a 
problem I said of course it will it's no longer a problem what you've given me is an 
exercise you are depriving me of information which you need to formulate the problem that's an 
exercise that's what a case study is it's not a problem it's an exercise but 
because the person who writes the case eliminates information which he used in 
formulating the case in order to condense it it's an exercise he said well if that's what you 
mean by an exercise there's nothing wrong with it it'll still teach you how to solve problems I said if I taught you how to 
box with one hand tied behind you does that teach you how to box with two hands he said you get killed when you go into 
the ring he said all right let me fix up that problem he said you look in the bowl now 
and all the balls are white you reach in and P out a handful of balls and M of 
them have a black core in the middle and N minus n have a white core in the 
middle now you pull out one ball which one what's the probability to have a black 
core I said how do you know that some of them have a black core and some don't he said boy he said you insist on 
spoiling the problem don't you he said all right let me give you one more formulation he said you got one 
of these pinball machines and you have two exits for the balls one on the right and one on the 
left and you shoot n balls and M of them come out on the right and N minus M come out on the left now you got one pull of 
the spring one ball goes up what's the probability of come out on the left I said give me a 
screwdriver he said what for I said I want to take the machine apart and see how it works he says you can't do that I 
said why not he said because it spoils a problem see he was reducing problems to 
exercises and exercises are not an exercise and problem solving it's 
learning how to box with one hand tie behind your back and that's not what reality is then we come along and we do 
something to an exercise we we remove the reason for taking it 
seriously we remove the context so we go ahead and ask a student 
how much is 2+ three now we ask that with a full conviction that there's only one 
possible answer and that's absolutely false you don't know the answer to the 
question 2 + 3 because you don't know the context am I talking about degrees 
Fahrenheit am I talking about logarithms am I talking about number 
systems to base six instead of base 10 all of these affect the 
answer but we teach students as though each question has an absolute context 
and an absolute answer turn therefore 2 + 2 has to be four and 2 + 3 has to be 5 
and don't make them aware of the fact that 2 + 3 can be 2 and A2 as it is if they're degrees 
Fahrenheit and the two bodies are the same volume and so on and on and on the relativity of questions is 
something we never ask so we don't make the distinction between problems exercises and questions 
and then there's another distinction we don't make the second of three 
there are four different ways of treating a problem one is 
Absolution that's the way we treat most problems you ignore it and hope it'll go away or solve itself so parents come 
home and find kids fighting and said let them alone they'll solve it that's absolving yourself of the 
problem problem resolution is a way of treating a problem where you dip into the past and 
say what have we done in the past it's a suggest something we can do in the present that would be good 
enough this is a clinical and experiential approach to problems is basically qualitative and common 
sensical in decision theoretic terms it looks for a satisficing answer an answer 
that is good enough it's the way the clinician Works problem solving looks for the best 
thing to do in the current circumstances it looks for an optimal solution it's quantitative versus qualitative 
experimental versus experiential and it's research-based and we leave students with the 
impression the best thing you can do with the problem is solve it and that's absolutely false because of a number of 
reasons one is that no problem ever stays solv but more importantly every 
solution creates new problems you see every problem in science that was formulated by Galileo has long since 
been solved but science hasn't disappeared because every time we saw solve a problem we create a new one a 
new one is harder than the old one the progress of science depends as much on a generation of new problems as it does on 
a generation of all solutions we don't teach people that but the important thing is there's 
something you can do to a problem is better than solving it and that's dissolving it how in the world do you 
dissolve a problem by redesigning the system that has it so that the problem no longer is 
exists there's a marvelous Story Probably apocryphal but I like to believe it's true of a young man who 
went to the Ohio match company many years ago with a 
proposal some of you are old enough to remember the paper books of matches which used to be given out every time 
you bought a package of cigarettes and there was a problem with those matches because if you left the cover open and 
struck a match on the abrasive on the front sometimes a spark would fly from 
the match and ignite the matches in the book and people would burn their 
hands and the Ohio match company used to receive at least a, suits a year from 
people who had burnt their hands well they got enough sense and printed on the bottom of the matchbox a 
little statement said please close the cover before striking you may remember 
that it turned out this didn't do two things first it didn't reduce their legal liability for burnt 
hands and secondly it didn't stop most people from striking matches with the book 
open now this young man came in he said suppose I could tell you how to make a 
paper book of matches in a way that people cannot possibly burn their hands and it will cost you no more to make 
that book of matches than it does to make the current one how much is it worth to you he said you tell us what 
the answer is and we'll tell you how much it's worth He said oh no you tell me how much it's worth and I'll 
tell you the answer well they wound up hiring lawyers who negotiated the 
contract and when the contract was finally negotiated involved actually $42,000 according to the 
story the contract was signed by both men I turned to the young man and said what are you what's your proposal he 
said take the abrasive and put it on the back of the matchbook cover and everyone subsequently was done 
that way see he didn't solved the problem he dissolved it he redesigned the matchbook cover so the problem no 
longer existed disillusion involves design 
solution involves research we don't recognize design as a way of dealing 
with problems is superior even to research and we don't teach design because we don't know it and don't 
understand it some of us like me was lucky enough to be trained in architecture where I learned it without 
knowing what I was learning the the architect as a profession is the only one I know of who 
really understands the system he's unconscious of his understanding that may be why he 
understands it he doesn't know what he's doing but he does it right see a family 
comes in and see an architect and they say we want to build a home and what we want is a house with 
three bedrooms a living room dining room and kitchen connected to each other we want a family room where the kids can 
play we want a two-car garage I want it all on one floor we'd like it to be whatever it is colonial or modern 
architecture we'd like it to cost under whatever it is $100,000 architect says fine let me 
think about it make some sketches you come back in a week and we'll talk about it now what does the architect 
do does he make a list of the rooms they want and then produce a design of each room and then say how do I put these 
together into a house is that what he does of course not what he does is produce the sketch of the house the 
hole and now he begins to put rooms in it he divides the space of the house up into 
rooms then he looks at it and he says well these bedrooms are a little too small and they're the wrong shape 
they're a little too long for their width so I ought to make them a little wider but that means changing the house 
should I change the house only if changing the house to 
accommodate the room makes the house better a part is never modified unless it makes 
the whole better that's the systemic principle you don't change the part 
because it makes the part better without considering its impact on the 
whole that's systemic thinking you don't improve the performance of a department 
of a university or a college unless you can demonstrate that doing so improves 
the whole but I've never seen in a university or college which evaluates 
departments in terms of their contribution to the H they're always evaluated in terms of their own 
performance because the university is treating treated anti- systemically as a group of autonomous independent entities 
called departments and so the potentiality for Learning and institutional Higher Learning has never 
been completely exhausted now the third thing about 
problems they don't exist there is no such thing as a problem 
that's an illusion well it's a concept really not an 
illusion a problem is to reality what an atom is to a 
table what you experience are tables not items you have a theory in a concept 
that tells you that if you reduce a table to its parts you will ultimately reach an indivisible part which used to 
be called an atom now it's a Parton or a quark doesn't make any difference 
but what you experience is the whole not the parts into which you have reduced it by conceptual 
reduction reality consists of a whole mess of problems 
interacting in fact reality is a system of 
problems a problem is an abstraction extracted from reality by 
analysis it's isolated from reality now what happens when you take a 
system apart it loses all of its essential properties and therefore when you take a 
situation and buy analysis reduce it to the problems of which it is composed you 
have lost all the essential properties of reality and the essential properties of 
the parts the problems when you take an automobile apart you got a motor sitting 
on the floor here that motor which is responsible for moving the car can't 
even move itself it loses its essential property when separated from the system 
of which it's a part and therefore the problems that we teach people to solve are 
Illusions they're not real they never have the interactions 
involved and so it was in the 1950s we had to recognize the need of developing whole new ways of formulating systems of 
problems which are now referred to technically is messes how do you formulate a mess and 
how do you solve it and the answer is by Design because it's only through design 
that you deal with the whole and move to the parts you see we are engaged as 
Educators in what might be called The Humpty Dumpty fallacy you remember the Humpty Dumpty 
sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall all the king's horses and All the 
King's Men can put Humpty Dumpty together again once the egg breaks you can't reassemble it that's happened to 
learning we broken it we got all these pieces and the question is how to bring them together well they can't be 
interdisciplinarity is nonsense the moment you have disciplines you can't bring them back together again 
you got a broken egg you're not going to put the the yolk and the wi back together again we got to start over from 
scotch and redesign the institution so that the whole 
is dealt with before the parts are created to fit the hole we do not design 
the hole to fit the parts which is what we're doing today the colleges and Assemblies of 
departments the Departments are not integral parts of the whole we have an 
incredible challenge facing us and are we going to stand up to it or are we 
going to try to preserve the capital that we've invested in our own education and transmit the complacent y 
that most of us have because we feel that we're reasonably well educated and the kids will be lucky if 
they're as well educated as we are which is a terrible crime because we 
ain't educated at all we're only beginning to realize how little we know 
about the nature of reality thank you [Music]
