a page inspired by **zettelkasten**   
+ vicky zhao

to systemize (into frameworks) all the copious notes i have gathered over decades  
in order to quiet my mind  
gain stillness  
& move perceptively - where my feet are  

the goal is always self actualization  
self exploartion  
liberation  
designing the life i love
