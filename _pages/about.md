what better way to start ?  

in attempting to learn to find stillness, perspective, to learn how it is i think, to learn more better ways to learn and create, to learn more in general...  

what about start with me   
with my life  
thinking in systems;  
developing mental models & frameworks;  
- OODA
- inversion
- 1st principles
- 2nd order thinking
- the map is not the territory  

practice & consistency  
practicing consistency  
yoga + movement  
journaling + meditation + mindful stillness  

getting money + getting gone  

simple life  
sinple living  
high ideals  
heavy thoughts
